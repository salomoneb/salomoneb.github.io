My latest, possibly soon-to-be-abandoned side-project is a Joe Biden generator - a single page application where a user clicks a button to randomly generate a [Joe Biden Onion story.](http://www.theonion.com/search?q=joe+biden) 

I'm about halfway there. Here's a [link](https://github.com/salomoneb/biden-generator/blob/master/biden_scraper.py) to the code which scrapes all of the Onion stories and outputs them to a JSON file. Next up: final data cleaning and designing the damn thing.
