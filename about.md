My name is Salomone Baquis, pronounced like *sol-uh-min bah-kweese*. 

I work at [Phone2Action](http://phone2action.com/), where I help people use our platform to connect with elected officials. Previously, I developed digital advocacy tools and campaigns at [Beekeeper Group](http://www.beekeepergroup.com).

Some of my interests include [running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LHid-nC45k), [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhF1cc7nCyg), and [technology](https://github.com/salomoneb).

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site built using the [Hagura](https://github.com/sharu725/hagura) theme. 

Get in touch with me below.
