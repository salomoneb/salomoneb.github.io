My name is Salomone Baquis, pronounced like *sol-uh-min bah-kweese*. 

I'm a project manager based in Washington, DC. Previously, I worked at [Beekeeper Group](http://www.beekeepergroup.com), where I helped build websites and digital tools for advocacy campaigns. 

Some of my interests include [running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LHid-nC45k), [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhF1cc7nCyg), and [technology](https://github.com/salomoneb).

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site built using the [Hagura](https://github.com/sharu725/hagura) theme. 

Get in touch with me below.
